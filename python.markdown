I mainly use python through Anaconda using Jupyter Notebooks. Currently learning: scikit-learn and seaborn.

### [Netflix Project]({{ site.url }}/python/netflix)
Data analysis using pandas, numpy, matplotlib, plotly, scipy, and scikit-learn to do exploratory analysis within the python ecosystem. This project was intended to help learn python syntax and packages. In pdf format to display plotly plots. Dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/syedmubarak/netflix-dataset-latest-2021).

### [Pok√©mon Correlations]({{ site.url }}/python/pkmn_corr)
Data analysis and multi-variate linear regression using Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn). This project was intended to further my regression model building and analysis skills in python. This project was helpful in learning on python tools to deal with indicator variables in regression models. Dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mariotormo/complete-pokemon-dataset-updated-090420).

### [Classifying and Clustering States Using Living Wage]({{ site.url }}/python/living_wage)
Machine Learning exploratory analysis for classification and clustering of State and wage data. This project was intended to start learning about and using various machine learning functions in python, as well as to continually learn about python for data science. Dataset adapted from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/brandonconrady/living-wage-50-states).

### [üêï Dog Web Scraper]({{ site.url }}/python/doggos) [+ Another Scraper For Specific Dog Info]({{ site.url }}/python/doggos_v2)
Smaller scale web scraper for dogs adoption profiles found on [a local rescue site](https://fetchwi.org/adopt). This project was intended for learn about how to build a web scraper in python, as well as exploring ways to store the data. I also am personally looking for a dog to adopt that would fit well with my lifestyle. '''Update:''' a new iterative web scraper that scrapes specific dog websites found in the previous scraper.
