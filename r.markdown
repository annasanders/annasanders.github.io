### [Pok√©mon Data Analysis]({{ site.url }}/r/STAT_2600_excerpt)
A final research paper for STAT 2600 - Introduction to Data Science. The class was structured into different groups for the entire semester. We would each complete a weekly lab with a group section and individual section analyzing different data sets to learn different R and R Studio skills. For our final lab, my group decided to analyze Pok√©mon video game data. This excerpt includes my section, as well as the overall project description and goals. 

### [Pok√©mon Dashboard]({{ site.url }}/r/pkmn_dshbrd)
A personal project using the shiny package in R Studio. I created a functional dashboard using updated Pok√©mon R datatable to create a searchable table, based on the main Pok√©mon metrics (e.g. Type, HP, Attack), show the corresponding image of the Pok√©mon from [serebii.net](https://www.serebii.net/index2.shtml), add special columns to the datatable, and add the selected Pok√©mon to a secondary table, where more information could be viewed and exported, as well as the overall 'team' type advantages/disadvantages could be calculated.
