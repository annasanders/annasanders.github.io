### [Pokémon Data Analysis]({{ site.url }}/assets/STAT 2600 Excerpt temp.pdf)
A final research paper for STAT 2600 - Introduction to Data Science. The class was structured into different groups for the entire semester.
We would each complete a weekly lab with a group section and individual section analyzing different data sets to learn different R and R Studio skills.
For our final lab, my group decided to analyze Pokémon video game data. This excerpt includes my section, as well as the overall project description and goals. 

### [Pokémon Dashboard]({{ site.url }}/r/pkmn_dshbrd)
A personal project using the shiny package in R Studio. I created a functional dashboard using updated Pokémon R datatable to create a searchable table, based on the main
Pokémon metrics (e.g. Type, HP, Attack), show the corresponding image of the Pokémon from serebii.net, add special columns to the datatable, and add the selected Pokémon to
a secondary table, where more information could be viewed and exported, as well as the overall 'team' type advantages/disadvantages could be calculated.
