👋 Hi, I’m [Anna Sanders]({{ site.url }}/about_me)!

🌱 I’m interested further developing my skills Data Science, Analysis, and Visualization

✨ Fun fact: I enjoy using emojis 😁

<h2 style="text-align:center;"> 🐢🐢🐢 Be Kind! This Website is Always In Progress 🐢🐢🐢 </h2>

<br>

## 🐉 What I'm Currently Proud Of: 

I have a working R Shiny App based off of my favorite Video Game Series: Pokémon. Find the link and code [here]({{ site.url }}/r/pkmn_dshbrd)!

## 🗺 Recent Website Updates: 

New theme colors! Fixing some broken links. Some more smaller projects because my computer has a very loud industrial grade dehumidifier next to it 🥲
