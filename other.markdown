### [Building This Website]({{ site.url }}/about_website)
How I built this website! As someone who did not have prior experience with website building or the tools needed to make it happen, I've written a quick guide on how to get started. I also have some tips and tricks on how to customize your website a bit more.

### [Quick SQL Tips & Tricks]({{ site.url }}/sql_tips)
Some quick SQL that I use, but can never remember the exact syntax of. 

### [PostgreSQL Install and Advanced Querying]({{ site.url }}/pgsql/pkmn)
This project was done to install a PostgreSQL on my device as well as start writing queries to explore datasets. I reused a condensed version of [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mariotormo/complete-pokemon-dataset-updated-090420). 

### [STATA Data Analysis]({{ site.url }}/files/ECON 4848 Final Research Paper.pdf)
A collaborative final research paper for ECON 4848 - Applied Econometrics (Upper Division).
My group chose to analyze our college's [Faculty Course Questionnaire (FCQ) results](https://www.colorado.edu/fcq/boulder-fcq-results), which are optional surveys for all courses taught at CU: Boulder, which students can complete a few weeks before the end of the semester. We used STATA to regress the public FCQ Data on multiple variables within the dataset to find statistically significant relationships. Our initial findings are described in the 10 page document above.
