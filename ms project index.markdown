Here is a repository of all projects completed for my MS-Data Science! Projects will be grouped by associated class.

### DSTA 5301 - Introduction to Data Science (ü¶è R Studio)

#### [NYPD Shooting Data Analysis]({{site.url}}/ms_projects/dsta5301_shooting_analysis)
Short project analyzing NYPD open access shooting data.

#### [COVID-19 Data Analysis]({{site.url}}/ms_projects/dsta5301_covid_analysis)
Project analyzing John Hopkins University global COVID data. The first part of the analysis, labeled "DSTA In Class Analysis" was part of the lectures for the class. The "Additional Analysis" section is my own analysis on Colorado county level COVID data. Interestingly, El Paso county seems to be the worst faring county in Colorado regarding COVID.

### DSTA 5304 - Data Visualization (üêç Python)

#### [Master's Degrees Awarded in Colorado]({{site.url}}/ms_projects/dsta5304_mastersdeg)
Project visualizing Master's degrees awarded in the state of Colorado from 2001-2017. The visualization was built in Altair and is interactive, both via the bottom degree program filter and on each individual plot legend. This page includes an interactive visualization!
