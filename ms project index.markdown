Here is a repository of all projects completed for my MS-Data Science! Projects will be grouped by associated class.

### DSTA 5301 - Introduction to Data Science (ü¶è R Studio)

#### [NYPD Shooting Data Analysis]({{site.url}}/ms_projects/dsta5301_shooting_analysis)
Short project analyzing NYPD open access shooting data.

#### [COVID-19 Data Analysis]({{site.url}}/ms_projects/dsta5301_covid_analysis)
Project analyzing John Hopkins University global COVID data. The first part of the analysis, labeled "DSTA In Class Analysis" was part of the lectures for the class. The "Additional Analysis" section is my own analysis on Colorado county level COVID data. Interestingly, El Paso county seems to be the worst faring county in Colorado regarding COVID.
