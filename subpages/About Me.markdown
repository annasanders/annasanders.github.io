## 🐜 A Bit About Me
I'm a recent college graduate (Fall 2020) from the University of Colorado: Boulder. I received a B.A. in Economics and Mathematics (Statistics Focus) and a minor in Chinese (Mandarin). I currently work a full-time job, so this whole thing is a weekend project/hobby for me!

[//]: #I started my college career with the intent to study International Affairs, so in addition to the economics and math classes, I have also taken classes in international relations and poli-sci. In Economics, I have taken classes in International Trade and Finance, Public Policy, and Antitrust and Regulation. In Mathematics, I have taken classes in Markov Processes, Time Series, and advanced Probability and Statistics. Outside of my major and minor, I enjoyed my Intro to LGBT Studies class and International Development class.

## 🤔 Why Data Analysis/Science?
Like most people graduating college, I had no actual idea what kind of job I wanted to do. I enjoyed Economics, but couldn't see myself working as an Economist (or getting a PHD either 🙃). After being in the workforce for a bit, I did some serious refection on what parts of my current job I enjoyed, what skills I currently had, and what interested me. Data analysis and data science is something that I think hits all three points for me personally. 

## 🖥️ Why A Website?
I decided on a personal website/portfolio because it is a great way to learn a new skill (I had never built a website before) and to show off my portfolio. When I recently had time off for the winter holiday season, I created the [R Shiny Pokémon Dashboard]({{ site.url }}/r/pkmn_dshbrd) and wanted to show it off. A website was a great way to do so. It's also weirdly delightful to have my own little personal site on the world-wide-web.

## 🎏 Interests and Hobbies
Since this is a hobby, most projects are also things I'm interested in. I greatly enjoy the Pokémon franchise and wish I could have my very own [Bronzong](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/bronzong/). My other hobbies include watching TV and YouTube, playing video games when I have time, as well as looking at cute dog pictures and daydreaming about my future dog. 

## 🪅 But Seriously, Why the Emojis? 
If they're there, I'm going to use them. Who doesn't want to see cute dinosaurs 🦕🦕🦕🦕🦕🦕🦕
